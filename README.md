# US States Game

This project is a game where the user guesses the names of the 50 US States.

If the user quits the game early, they'll receive a csv file containing the names of the states they did not guess correctly.

In order to run main.py, you will need the Pandas package, "50_states.csv", and "blank_states_img.gif".

To download Pandas, you may need the latest version of Python.
